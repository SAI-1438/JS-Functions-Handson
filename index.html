    <h1>Q1.Create one function with zero parameter having a console statement</h1>
    <pre>function a(){
        console.log("a");
    }
    a();
    </pre>
    <h1>Q2.Create one function which takes two values as a parameter and print the sum of them as "Sum of 3, 4 is 7"</h1>
    <pre>function Add(a,b){
        sum=a+b;
        console.log(sum);
    }
    Add(1,2);
    </pre>
    <h1>Q3.Create one arrow function</h1>
    <pre>let add = (a,b) => a*b;
        console.log(add(3,4));
    </pre>
    <h1>Q4. 
        var x = 21;
        var girl = function () {
            console.log(x);
            var x = 20;
        };
        girl ();
    </h1>
    <p><b>Output:</b>Undefined  :--The Output was Undefined because within the function of girl the console was<br>
                            called before the initialization of the value of x but the memory of x was given. <br>
                            hence, as per code execution the result will be given as there is no value defined 
    </p> 
    <h1>Q5. 
        var x = 21;
        girl ();
        console.log(x)
        function girl() {
                console.log(x);
                var x = 20;
        };
    </h1>
    <p><b>Output:</b>Undefined,21  :--The Output was Undefined for the first console because the girl function was called in <br>
                               the second line of code and as per execution context in the girl function the x was consoled <br>
                               after the memory alocation itself but not after the value initialization. Hence, the result was Undefined as there is no value defined.<br>
                               The second console gave the result as 21 because the value of x the console took it as from the global scope. </p>
    <h1>Q6.
        var x = 21;
        a();
        b();
        function a() {    
            x = 20;
            console.log(x);
        };
        function b() {    
            x = 40;
            console.log(x);
        };
    </h1>
    <p><b>Output:</b>20,40  :--The Output 20 was given by the console called in the function a<br>
                        The Output 40 was given by the console called in the function b<br>
                        Hence, when the both a and b functions are called in the code the results are as follows.
    </p>
    <h1>Q7.Write a function that accepts parameter n and returns factorial of n</h1>
    <pre>function factorial(n){
        let fact=1;
        for(let i=n;i>=1;i--){
            fact=fact*i;
        }
        return fact;
        }
        console.log(factorial(4));
    </pre>
    <p><b>Output:</b>24</p>
    <h1>Q8.
        function FindSum(a, b){
            return a + b;
        }
        function DisplayData(data, batch){
            console.log(`i am from ${data} and My batch is EA${batch}`)
        }
        DisplayData("PrepBytes", FindSum(10, 11));
    </h1>
    <p><b>Output:</b> i am from PrepBytes and My batch is EA21  :--As Second function waits for the first function so, the second function was called as a callby function.<br>
                        Hence, as per the result the value of data was taken from the Display function and for batch value it took the funtion FindSum so the value was21<br>
                        So, as per those data and batch values the console output was as follows "i am from PrepBytes and My batch is EA21"</p>
    <h1>Q9.
        Abc();
        const Abc = function(){
            let value = 20;
            console.log(value);
        }
    </h1>
    <p><b>Output:</b>Abc cannot be accessed before initialization :-- here the function is defined with a vairable Abc and the function is being called directly and such that<br>
                     this type of fucntion does not follow the hoisting concept thats why it return as Error Abc cant access. </p>
    <h1>Q10.
        var a = 10;
        (function (){
            console.log(a);
            var a = 20;
        })();
    </h1>
    <p><b>Output:</b> Undefined :-- because within the function the console was called before the value is initialized but the memory alocation was done. Hence, the value was given a undefined.</p>
    <h1>Q11.
        const greet =  function(name){
            return function(m){   
                console.log(`Hi!! ${name}, ${m}`);
            }
        }
        const greet_message = greet('EA21');
        greet_message("Welcome To PrepBytes")
    </h1>
    <p><b>Output:</b>  Hi!! EA21, Welcome To PrepBytes :--As per the console the value of name was given by the greet funtion arguments and the value of m was given by the greet_message function arguments.<br>
                        Hence, the output by the both functional values is as follows "Hi!! EA21, Welcome To PrepBytes".</p>
